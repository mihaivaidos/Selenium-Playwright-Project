I participated in a 10km non-competitive running race in Bergamo. The results were not ranked because it was non-competitive, but I wanted to know my rank so I extracted the results from the race with selenium and playwright, sorted them and saved them in a txt file. The project was made in Java with the help of the internet as well as AI.
